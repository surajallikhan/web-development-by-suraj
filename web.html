 <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
   <h2>Paragraph 1</h2>
   <h3>Definition</h3>
<p>A Library Management System (LMS) is a software application that helps in managing library resources, including books, users, borrowing transactions, and fines.
This research focuses on comparing the implementation of an LMS using Python with JSON storage versus Python with NetworkX graph-based representation to analyze performance, efficiency, scalability, and ease of development.

<h3>Why is it important in today’s world?</h3>
<p>As libraries transition to digital platforms, the choice of data storage and processing plays a significant role in managing large datasets effectively.
JSON-based storage provides a lightweight, document-based approach, whereas NetworkX leverages graph structures to model relationships between books, users, and transactions.
This study helps determine the best approach for handling real-world LMS applications in Python.</p>
<h3>Applications of the research</h3>
<p>The findings can help developers and institutions select the best approach for implementing digital library systems.
The performance analysis can guide developers in choosing graph-based or document-based storage for large-scale data-driven applications.
Insights from this research can also be applied to other management systems, such as student records, hospital databases, or social network analysis.</p>
<h2>Paragraph 2</h2>
<h3>Total number of articles published in this topic over the past 5 years</h3>
<p>Research on <strong>Library Management Systems</strong>, Python for Data Storage, and Graph-based Data Representation has been widely published in journals indexed by Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, Science Direct, and Springer.
Studies specifically comparing JSON and NetworkX in library or database applications have emerged in recent years.</p>
